# tool4autoMovePicture

This repository contains a simple tool for moving images from a source folder to a destination folder.

A basic graphical interface built with Tkinter is included under `app/main.py`.
Run it with:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

The UI uses a flat style to keep the layout clean and minimal.
